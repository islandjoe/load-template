# Load Template

This is a Brackets Extension that simply loads the content of a template file into a currently open and empty file (in Brackets). The contents of the template file will highly depend on your purpose. 

For me, the template contains HTML and Hammer for Mac tags that becomes a new blog post. This could have also been easily done by copy and pasting from a snippets file, but with this being a Brackets extension makes my Hammer for Mac workflow much smoother.
